# MissileRush
This is our matchmaker game. We created this game using Unity and C#.
Our team consisted of 2 developers and 3 artists.
It's a mobile game where the player tries to destroy the mothership by navigating a missile.
The main challenge for us when we were creating this game was to make the game perform well on mobile phones and to make the game in such a short time.
To achieve good performance we used objectpooling and removed our gameobjects at optimal times.
